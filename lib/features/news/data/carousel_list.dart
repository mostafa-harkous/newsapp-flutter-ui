      description: "In the furthest reaches of the Celestial Veil, astronomers from the Chronos Observatory have discovered a new star, unlike any seen before. Dubbed 'Lyra's Whisper, this cosmic anomaly does not burn with fire but hums with pure, crystalline sound. Its light is not a glow but a shimmering echo, a visible melody that paints the nebula around it in hues of amethyst and silver. This star, it is said, holds the forgotten songs of the universe, and its discovery has left scientists in awe, suggesting that the very fabric of space is not just silent and dark, but a symphony waiting to be heard.",
